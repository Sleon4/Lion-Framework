[![Latest Stable Version](http://poser.pugx.org/lion-framework/lion-framework/v)](https://packagist.org/packages/lion-framework/lion-framework) [![Total Downloads](http://poser.pugx.org/lion-framework/lion-framework/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/lion-framework/lion-framework) [![License](http://poser.pugx.org/lion-framework/lion-framework/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/lion-framework/lion-framework) [![PHP Version Require](http://poser.pugx.org/lion-framework/lion-framework/require/php)](https://packagist.org/packages/lion-framework/lion-framework)

#### Note: very soon youtube tutorials on the basic operation of the framework

## Install
```shell
composer create-project lion-framework/lion-framework
```

```shell
composer install
```

# Lion-Framework the API Backend
Lion-Framework can also serve as an API backend for a JavaScript single page application or a mobile application. For example, you can use Lion-Framework as an API backend for your Vite.js app or Kotlin app. <br>

You can use Lion-Framework to provide authentication and data storage/retrieval for your application, while taking advantage of Lion-Framework services such as emails, databases, and more.

## Usage
Start by running the server, by default it runs on port `8000`.
```shell
php lion serve
```

use another port.
```shell
php lion serve --port=8001
```

## Commands
More information about the use of internal commands. [Lion-Command](https://github.com/Sleon4/Lion-Command)
```shell
php lion serve
php lion new:controller <name_controller>
php lion new:model <name_model>
php lion new:middleware <name_middleware>
php lion new:command <name_command>
php lion new:capsule <name_capsule>
php lion new:test <name_test>
php lion key:rsa
php lion test
php lion token:jwt
php lion route:list
```

## Optional Parameters
```shell
php lion serve --port=8001
php lion key:rsa --path="storage/other-secret-key/"
```

## Route list
To view the available routes, start the local server first, run the `php lion serve` command, and then view the routes.
```shell
php lion route:list
```

## Add commands
The commands must be added in an array from `routes/console.php`
```php
$commands = [
    // commands
    // example App\Console\NewCommand::class
];
```

Warning note: Routes are loaded with server path `SERVER_URL` set in .env, modify this path to avoid errors in process execution.

### 1. ROUTES AND MIDDLEWARE
Lion-Route has been implemented for route handling. More information at [Lion-Route](https://github.com/Sleon4/Lion-Route), from the web you can add all the necessary routes for the operation of your web application `routes/web.php`
```php
Route::any('/', function() {
	return LionRequest\Response::success("Welcome to index");
});
```

Middleware is easy to implement. They must have the main class imported into `Middleware`, which initializes different functions and objects at the Middleware level. <br>
The rule for middleware is simple, in the constructor they must be initialized with the `$this->init()` function. More information about the use of Middleware in [Lion-Route](https://github.com/Sleon4/Lion-Route).
```php
namespace App\Http\Middleware\JWT;

use App\Http\Middleware\Middleware;
use LionSecurity\JWT;

class AuthorizationMiddleware extends Middleware {

    public function __construct() {
        $this->init();
    }

    public function exist(): void {
        $headers = apache_request_headers();

        if (!isset($headers['Authorization'])) {
            $this->processOutput(
                $this->response->error('The JWT does not exist')
            );
        }
    }

    public function authorize(): void {
        $headers = apache_request_headers();

        if (preg_match('/Bearer\s(\S+)/', $headers['Authorization'], $matches)) {
            $jwt = JWT::decode($matches[1]);
            if ($jwt->status === 'error') $this->processOutput($jwt);
        } else {
            $this->processOutput(
                $this->response->error('Invalid JWT')
            );
        }
    }

    public function notAuthorize(): void {
        $headers = apache_request_headers();

        if (isset($headers['Authorization'])) {
            $this->processOutput(
                $this->response->error('User in session, You must close the session')
            );
        }
    }

}
```

to add a middleware you must open the middleware file located in `routes/middleware.php`, where there are default middleware for the use of JWT.
```php
LionRoute\Route::newMiddleware([
	App\Http\Middleware\JWT\AuthorizationMiddleware::class => [
		['name' => "jwt-exist", 'method' => "exist"],
		['name' => "jwt-authorize", 'method' => "authorize"],
		['name' => "jwt-not-authorize", 'method' => "notAuthorize"]
	]
]);
```

### 2. CONTROLLERS
Controllers are easy to implement. They must have the parent class imported into `Controller`, which initializes different functions and objects at the Controller level. <br>
The rule for Controllers is simple, in the constructor they must be initialized with the `$this->init()` function.
```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

class HomeController extends Controller {

	public function __construct() {
		$this->init();
	}

	public function index() {
		return $this->response->warning('Page not found. [index]');
	}

}
```

### 3. MODELS
The models are easy to implement. They must have the main class imported into `Model`, which initializes various functions and objects at the model level. <br>
The rule for models is simple, in the constructor they must be initialized with the `$this->init()` function.
```php
namespace App\Models;

use App\Models\Model;

class HomeModel extends Model {

	public function __construct() {
		$this->init();
	}

}
```

Note that when you want to implement methods that implement processes with databases, the `LionSql\Drivers\MySQLDriver` class must be imported for their respective operation. more information on [Lion-SQL](https://github.com/Sleon4/Lion-SQL). <br>
Note that at the framework level Lion-SQL is already installed and implemented, the variables are located in the `.env` file, follow the import instructions for their use.
